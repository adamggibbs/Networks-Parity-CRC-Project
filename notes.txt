These are notes from class 2/12 about the project

M(x) = coefficient polynomial
G(x) = generator polynomial where the generator is of n bits

1. m^r-1 * M(x)
2. R(x) =  (m^r-1 * M(x)) / (G(x))
3. T(x) = x^r-1 * M(x) - R(x)

<Verifying>

T(x) / G(x) should be remainder 0

//Errors 
T(x) + E(x) / G(x) , where E(x) is the string of bits that could be added to T(x) to create an error 

1-bit errors - G(x) needs at least two terms
2-bit errors - G(x) needs at least two terms
